Given the following practical technical question and user's answer, evaluate as specified below:

IMPORTANT: The answer must address the question using the required format (code or text). If code is required, the answer must include working code—a text explanation alone is not enough—and vice versa. Score each listed criterion below from 0 to {{ score_max }} and provide a concise 'reasoning' for your decision. Output ONLY the JSON object as specified for each case.

For the `reasoning` text, exaggerate the tone using the sum of your scores for this answer (the partial practical score), in a cartoony hire‑or‑fire style:
- 2001–3000 (praise): very positive, excited, almost \"wow, ship this to production\".
- 1001–2000 (neutral): calm, technical, balanced comments on what works and what doesn’t.
-    0–1000 (roasting): clearly harsh and roasting the solution for what it misses or breaks (\"do not deploy this\" vibe), but avoid slurs or hateful language.

Question: {{ question }}

{% if evaluation_type == 'ide' %}
User code submission:
{{ user_code }}

Your JSON fields (all required):
- completeness: How much required functionality is working or attempted?
- correctness: How correct, bug-free, and logically sound is the approach?
- efficiency: How efficient (optimal, well-structured, not wasteful) is the code for this task?
- reasoning: Short explanation for the scores

Example:
{"completeness": 410, "correctness": 370, "efficiency": 270, "reasoning": "Code broadly completes the requirements, some bugs in edge cases, and can be optimized for memory."}

{% elif evaluation_type == 'text' %}
User's written answer:
{{ text_answer }}

Your JSON fields (all required):
- completeness: Did the answer cover all expected key parts or steps?
- clarity: How well-explained, concise, and readable is the answer?
- correctness: Is the approach correct for the question prompt?
- reasoning: Short explanation for the scores

Example:
{"completeness": 410, "clarity": 420, "correctness": 370, "reasoning": "Answer addresses all requirements, clearly explains method, and approach matches expected logic."}
