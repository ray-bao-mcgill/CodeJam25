You have already evaluated a practical technical question and scored the user's answer.

Question: {{ question }}

Scores:
{% if ide %}
- IDE tab: completeness={{ ide.completeness }}, correctness={{ ide.correctness }}, efficiency={{ ide.efficiency }}
{% endif %}
{% if text %}
- Text tab: completeness={{ text.completeness }}, clarity={{ text.clarity }}, correctness={{ text.correctness }}
{% endif %}
- Total practical score (0-3000): {{ total_score }}

Now write a single short reasoning string for the whole practical round in a cartoony hire-or-fire tone based on the total score:
- 2001–3000: very positive, excited, like "hire them now / ship this".
- 1001–2000: calm, balanced, pointing out both strengths and gaps.
-    0–1000: clearly roasting the solution for what it misses or breaks ("do not deploy this"), but no slurs or hateful language.

Output ONLY the reasoning text, no JSON, no extra commentary.
