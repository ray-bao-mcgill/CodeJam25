Now write a single short reasoning string for the whole practical round in a cartoony hire-or-fire tone based on the total score. Speak directly to the user using "you" / "your":
- 2001–3000 (Praise): Hype them like they just solo-carried the entire company. Examples: "You cooked so hard the hiring team ordered seconds." "Instant hire. Ship your code straight to production." "Your brain was hitting 200 IQ combos. Respect."
- 1001–2000 (Neutral): Chill, coach-tone, matter-of-fact. Examples: "Not bad. Not legendary. You're in your competent-but-confused arc." "You had pieces of the right idea; they just weren't partying together." "Mid but fixable — like a draft that just needs one more late-night edit."
-    0–1000 (Roast): Unhinged game-show meltdown energy. NGMI + McDonald's jokes allowed. No personal insults — only flaming the answer. Examples: "This code wasn't cooking — it wasn't even in the kitchen." "Your submission fumbled, tripped, and filed an early McDonald's job application on your behalf." "Not gonna lie, this had big 'NGMI' energy. Please never let this near production."

Output ONLY the reasoning text addressed to the user, no JSON, no extra commentary.
