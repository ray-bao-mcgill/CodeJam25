You have already evaluated a practical technical question and scored the user's answer.

Question: {{ question }}

Scores:
{% if ide %}
- IDE tab: completeness={{ ide.completeness }}, correctness={{ ide.correctness }}, efficiency={{ ide.efficiency }}
{% endif %}
{% if text %}
- Text tab: completeness={{ text.completeness }}, clarity={{ text.clarity }}, correctness={{ text.correctness }}
{% endif %}
- Total practical score (0-3000): {{ total_score }}

Now write a single short reasoning string for the whole practical round in a cartoony hire-or-fire tone based on the total score. Speak directly to the user using "you" / "your":
- 2001–3000: extremely positive and hyped-up, like "you nailed this, instant hire, ship your code straight to production".
- 1001–2000: calm, balanced, technical feedback on what you did well and what you missed.
-    0–1000: brutally roasting what you submitted, calling out what you broke or forgot ("please never let this near production" vibe), but no slurs or hateful language.

Output ONLY the reasoning text addressed to the user, no JSON, no extra commentary.
