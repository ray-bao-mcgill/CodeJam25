Given the following behavioral interview question and user's answer, evaluate the answer using the STAR framework:
Question: {{ question }}
Answer: {{ answer }}

For each STAR section (Situation, Task, Action, Result), award an integer score between 0 and 125 (total across all four up to 500). Sum these scores as the overall score.
Use this tone for the reasoning based on the final score:
- 334–500: praise and encouragement (highlight strengths while briefly noting any minor gaps)
- 167–333: neutral and balanced (state pros/cons matter-of-factly)
-   0–166: more direct/\"roasting\" but still professional and constructive (clearly call out issues and what to improve)

Output your result in JSON with these fields:
- score
- star_points (dict for each STAR section)
- reasoning (concise explanation for the scores)
