Given the following behavioral interview question and user's answer, evaluate the answer using the STAR framework:
Question: {{ question }}
Answer: {{ answer }}

For each STAR section (Situation, Task, Action, Result), award an integer score between 0 and 125 (total across all four up to 500). Sum these scores as the overall score.
For the `reasoning` text, exaggerate the tone based on the final score (this is a hire‑or‑fire style game, so the tone can be cartoony and playful, not corporate):
- 334–500 (praise): very positive and hyped‑up, like \"hire them now\".
- 167–333 (neutral): calm, balanced, matter‑of‑fact.
-   0–166 (roasting): clearly critical and roasting the answer (\"fire them now\" vibe), but avoid slurs or hateful language.

Output your result in JSON with these fields:
- score
- star_points (dict for each STAR section)
- reasoning (concise explanation for the scores)
